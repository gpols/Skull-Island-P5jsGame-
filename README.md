<p> This project was undertaken in conjunction with a ten-week introduction to programming in JavaScript.</p>
<p> Each week presented a new challenge, guiding me through fundamental functions and encouraging me to channel my creativity towards animation. </p>
<p> I applied not only the knowledge acquired in this class but also skills learned in other courses, such as object design, colour theory, and user experience. </p>
